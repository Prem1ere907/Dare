# Dare
Open sourced Discord VC mock for youtube videos.

I reccommend you add a new user(#).png when you use this. And replace the current user1.png. 

There is currently no limit of users.

**Instructions**

1. Click "Enable Microphone"
2. Your good to go!

**Settings**
If you want to remove the fade effect for when you click a user. Do so in the "Settings" dropdown selection!

If you want more than 1 user, enter an amount of users you want in the bottom left tab!
